          <h2>How I Got Into Coding</h2>

          <h2>My Typical Day in College</h2>
          <p>A day at college is a mix of classes, chai breaks, coding practice, and sometimes badminton. Group studies and last-minute submissions add to the chaos but also make it memorable.</p>

          <h2>Why I Started Working Out</h2>
          <p>Staring at screens all day made me realize the importance of physical health. Just 30 minutes of home workouts or playing badminton gives me more energy and mental clarity.</p>

          <h2>Building a Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>Failures used to demotivate me, but now I see them as feedback. Whether it's a bug that took hours or a project that didn’t work out, everything teaches something valuable.</p>
